      <h3>Home</h3>
      <p>
        The first and most important idea of this website is to be a museum to Copy abilities from the Kirby Franchise. Over the years in the Kirby series, the main protagonist being Kirby is able to inhale his foes and copy their abilities. Sometimes he can breathe fire, use a sword and turn tiny, there are a lot of different forms Kirby can take and this website aims to put these on a virtual podium for all to see. 

For the home page, it’s intended to welcome the users and describe everything they should be able to do on this website. There will be a quick history on Kirby and the start of his copy mechanic in the series. From this point forward, users will be able to jump right into the museum by selecting a museum tab which will take the user to the second page.

      </p>
      <p>Images for the Home page</p>
        <img src="images/kirby_brawl.png" alt="Kirby">
        <img src="images/kirby_star_rod.png" alt="Kirby with star rod">

      </ul>
      <h3>Copy Abilities</h3>
      <p>
        Upon reaching the second page, the user will be prompted by big words to select an ability they are interested in looking at. The abilities will be organized alphabetically to start but there will be a filter system to organize them differently such as first appearance, most recent, element based and weapon based. The abilities will take form as the icon that appears in games with a word beneath the picture indicating which copy form that is. If a user clicks on one of the forms, a little popup will appear displaying the ability and a history of it. This history will include the year and game it first appeared in as well as different forms or links it had to other abilities in the past. There will be some fun facts about each form and even the different hats over time that Kirby has worn with the same copy ability.

        <img src="images/fire.webp" alt="Fire icon">

      </ul>
      <h3>Fusion and Mouthful abilities</h3>
      <p>
        Now the third and last page will hold the fusion abilities. Starting from Kirby 64, Kirby was able to take one copy ability and fuse it with another to create something brand new. It was later simplified but there are still too many to put in the second page so I plan to separate them from the singular abilities. The format will be similar with the icon showing where to click and the name of the form being displayed below it. The user should be able to filter at first appearance date or even how complex the fusion is whether the fusion makes a brand new ability in general or just simply adds an element to an already existing ability.

I forgot to mention for the second page that the abilities will also include the upgraded forms they received from the most recent titles in the series and the user will be able to access it from the base form then toggle through them once selected. Another thing that will be described is the history of the enemies that give Kirby the described abilities whether that copy form was only given by a boss or just a regular enemy later on. The last thing that will be mentioned in the fusion area is the animal friends. In Kirby’s Dreamland 2 and 3, Kirby can team up with different animals and each one takes an already existing ability and expands upon it so that will be mentioned here as well. 

Overall this website is just meant to be a love letter to the Kirby series from me and I always loved talking about it with friends and it can be hard to keep track of all the different copy abilities over the years so I hope this website can help those learn more rather than just going to a messing unorganized wiki.

        Wireframes

      <p>
        Create three wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them here</p>

      <h3>Home</h3>
      <p>         
        This is simply the home page, which will quickly try to lead users into the other pages of the website.

      <h3>[Page 2]</h3>
      <p>         
        Each image here will show a copy ability which the user can click on to display a poppup containing details about said ability.

      <h3>[Page 3]</h3>

        Basically the same as page 2 but with fusion abilities rather than singular abilites
